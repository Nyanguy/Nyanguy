### Hey y'all 👋

I am a Rust/Python software engineer.    
As for Python side, Cython, Numba and Numpy are my best friends.    
My political views can be described as: GIL is ok, `:=` is great.

- 🦀🐍 I'm actively interested in the development of Rust & Python.
- :checkered_flag: slowly learning Go.
- 🧑‍💻 I want to write more C/C++ code, but I just usually opt for Rust without even thinking.
- 🤤 things like **`Q_rsqrt`** make me happy.
- 💖 it makes my heart warm, when performance is at max.
- :muscle: perf matters.
- 👷 I’m currently working at QB as a Lead Project Engineer.
- 🏆 I've written and designed: 
  - 🤓 a high-performance multiprocessing framework with Cython/Numba/Numpy to perform data analisys;
  - 🦀 and then reimplemented it's core in Rust with a Python front-end [hooray! threading for humans!].
  - 🤟 a couple DSL from scratch;
  - 🤖 a couple of slack-bots for optimised workflow.
  - 🕸 a couple web apps for monitoring. IOT-like problems. [Django/Vue | Flask/React]
  - :infinity: adopted InfluxDB 2 to solve my statistics problems. Waiting for the IOx core.
- 🤢 **not** a fan of a front-end web-development. Keep your sleazy _revolutionary_ frameworks away.
