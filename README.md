### Hey y'all 👋

I am a Python software developer specialized in cpu-bound tasks.
So tools like Cython, Numba and Numpy are my best friends.

- 🦀 I'm actively learning Rust.
- :checkered_flag: as well as learning Go.
- 👷 I’m currently working at QB.
- 🏆 I've written: 
  - 🤓 a high-performance multiprocessing framework in Cython/Numba/Numpy to perform data analisys;
  - 🦀 and then reimplemented it's core in Rust with a Python front-end. 
  - 🤟 a DSL from scratch; 
  - 🤖 a couple of slack-bots for optimised workflow.
  - 🕸 a couple web apps for monitoring. [Django/Vue]
- 🤢 **not** a fan of a front-end development.
