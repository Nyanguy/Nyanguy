### Hey y'all 👋

I am a Python software developer specialized in cpu-bound tasks.
So tools like Cython, Numba and Numpy are my best friends.

- 👷 I’m currently working at QB.
- 🏆 I've written: 
  - 🤓 a high-performance multiprocessing framework to perform data analisys;
  - 🤟 a DSL from scratch; 
  - 🤖 a couple of slack-bots for optimised workflow.
  - 🕸 a couple web apps for monitoring. [Django/Vue]
- 🦀 I've been actively learning Rust.
- 🤢 I'm **not** a fan of the front-end.
- 🚀 I can implement almost anything in: Python/Cython, Rust, C, C++. (with respect to the time ⏳)
